      <h2>why we started bioworks</h2>
      <p>
        4 letters make up the entire biological code. As a Biology and Technology company, we aim to program biological cells to
        do the heavy lifting; for the advancement of mankind. This will be achieved by translating computer bits to RNA & DNA
        and finally functional proteins that can direct cells to perform desired functions

      </p>
      <p>
        Driven by programmers and biologists, we are reinventing how biology and technology interact providing solutions to
        modern day problems such as biofuels, better industrial processes, sustainable therapeutics and cleaner environments.
